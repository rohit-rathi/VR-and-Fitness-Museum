# VR-and-Fitness-Museum
Unity project that allows you to see how VR and fitness can be combined together to make exercising more fun.

I have created a museum where the user gets to see how VR can be used to make exercising more enjoyable. The user ‘walks’ through the museum and looks at different canvases. The user gets to explore the cons of conventional training methods and then compare it to working out in VR.

A walk through of this video is shown here: https://youtu.be/ngTPWnuyQjA.

To build this on your phone, you need to go to open Museum of Sports/Assets/Scene.unity.
